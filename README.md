# Executive Summary: 

Problem: High booking cancellation rates impact hotelsâ€™ revenue and occupancy stability, especially during low-demand periods. To address this, our goal is to reduce cancellations, optimize occupancy, and increase revenue through targeted marketing and predictive modeling.

Solution: 
- Use predictive modeling with logistic regression to identify high-risk cancellations and enable proactive retention strategies.
- Implement targeted marketing campaigns focused on demographics prone to cancellation, encouraging booking retention and personalized offers.
- Apply dynamic pricing to attract guests during low-demand periods and overbooking strategies during high-demand periods based on cancellation predictions.
- Analyze demand patterns to optimize staffing levels, ensuring sufficient employees during peak times while minimizing costs during slower periods.
- Predict demand to set optimal room prices, allowing for price increases during high-demand periods and discounts or special offers during low-demand times.
